# Footprint-Matching
GAN-CNN based footprint matching of crime scene photos

Pattern Recognition has proven to be a very powerful tool in many real-world applications like medical screening, radar systems, voice recognition, text classification, fingerprint analysis and so on. In this paper, we focus on one of its applications - Analysis of Footwear Impressions. The problem of footwear impression is about matching an image of a footwear imprint to one among the set of given reference footwear impressions, each corresponding to a different shoe model. This sort of pattern matching is particularly useful for crime scene investigations where footwear impressions are found. However, the problem of footwear impression recognition is particularly challenging due to the following reasons-
- Footwear impressions occur in structured noise conditions, but the structured noise can be from a large number of sources (snow, mud, sand, etc.) Sometimes, even the mud sticking to the bottom of the shoe leaves an impression on a surface.
- Sometimes only partial footwear impressions are recovered from the crime scene and the algorithm should take that into account.
- Most shoe prints have some sort of periodic pattern. However, these periodic patterns could have a phase shift between the reference and given impression.
